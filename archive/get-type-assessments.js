   # API Definition
   GET /typesAssignments

   # Description
   Get all type assignments.

   Note: The purpose of type assignments is to associate a TypeDef with an EventMatcher. For each Event that matches
   the criteria of the EventMatcher, Dapr applies special attributes of the TypeDef, which may alter how Dapr
   handles the event.

   # Response Body
   [TypeAssignment, ...]

   # Types
   TypeAssignment:
   matcher: Matcher
   typeId: Integer
